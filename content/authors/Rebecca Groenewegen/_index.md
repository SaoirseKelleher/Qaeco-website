Alongside partner organisations, Bec's work focuses on refining monitoring and modelling methods in conservation applications. For example, using Bayesian methods to estimate invasive predator densities in management scenarios, and to develop integrated population models to elicit crucial population parameters in threatened species translocations. Bec also works as a research assitant in the repliCATS project's Data Management and Analysis Team.
