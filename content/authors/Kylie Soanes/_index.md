Kylie is a conservation biologist with her sights set on saving species in cities and towns. Whether it's building bridges to help endangered possums cross busy roads,  working with architects to build designer houses for one of Australia's largest owls, or engaging citizen scientists to track the movement of city-dwelling fairy wrens, Kylie is always looking for new ways to help nature thrive in urban environments. Kylie is also a passionate science communicator, sharing her work with broader audiences through the media, public talks and her research blog, and her role as one of Science and Technology Australia's Superstars of STEM.
