Islay was a Master's student building species distribution models for Plains-wanderers. Her research developed temporally explicit species distribution models, including dynamic variables such as NDVI, which aim to make more ecologically relevant predictions for species, that like Plains-wanderers, have variable distributions over time. She is a Kiwi who came to Melbourne to study and holds a Bachelor of Science majoring in ecology.
