Kate was a research fellow in the Biodiversity Dynamics Research Group. Her research focused on the effects of fire on plant resilience in fire-prone ecosystems in Victoria, as part of a state-wide ecosystem resilience monitoring program implemented by the state government. 

She completed her PhD with QAECO from 2017-2020, exploring drivers of mammal and reptile abundance in fire-prone, 'mallee' woodlands of south-eastern Australia. She is a keen field ecologist and has a particular love for small mammals. Kate aims to conduct applied research that can inform environmental management and works closely with land managers to achieve this.
