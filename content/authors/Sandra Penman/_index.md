Sandra is completing a PhD on how bat communities are affected by fire. Her work focuses on the indirect impacts of fire, specifically changes in vegetation structure and prey availability. Sandra's work is based in forests of SE Australia where she likes to look at trees and contemplate future fire regimes.
