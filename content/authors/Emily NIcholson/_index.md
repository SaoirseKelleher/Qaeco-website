I am a Professor of Conservation Biology at The University of Melbourne, in the School of Agriculture, Food and Ecosystem Sciences (SAFES). Prior to this, I worked at Deakin University from 2015 to 2023, and from 2012 until Feb 2015, I was a Centenary Research Fellow at The University of Melbourne in QAEco. Before that, I was a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow at Imperial College London, working with E.J. Milner-Gulland and her group (2007-2012), and a postdoc in the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, working with David Wilcove (2006-2007).

I develop new theories and tools for improved conservation outcomes built on multidisciplinary collaboration, scientific excellence and impact on policy and practice. My interests include global conservation policy, predicting the impacts of change on biodiversity and dependent human well-being, and making better conservation decisions. A major focus over the last decade has been the development of a new framework for understanding, quantifying and predicting risks to ecosystems, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, with demonstrated impacts on conservation policy and practice, at global and local levels.
