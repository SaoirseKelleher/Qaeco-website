Bronwyn is a Research Fellow working on the conservation of Australia's native mammals.  Her research involves a mix of fieldwork, quantitative analyses and simulation modelling, with the aim of improving management of invasive predators and fire. She works with land management agencies to identify priority research questions, conduct landscape-scale field experiments and develop decision-support tools. Most of her fieldwork is conducted in the forests and heathlands of south-western Victoria.
