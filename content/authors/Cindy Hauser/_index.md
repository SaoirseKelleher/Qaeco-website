Cindy Hauser now works as a Senior Scientist at the Arthur Rylah Institute, following 12 years as a researcher in QAECO; she continues to collaborate with QAECO researchers. In both contexts, she uses the tools of decision science, maths and statistics to help agencies structure and address their environmental challenges. Her current projects include: state-wide prioritisation of government resources for conservation, integrating expert-elicited predictions and ecological survey data to predict faunal responses to fire, optimal deployment of surveillance effort in hawkweed and willow management programs, improved methods for biological control decision-making, and developing flexible and dynamic resource allocation strategies.
