David is a quantitative and spatial ecologist specialising in global change ecology. He is interested in the processes that drive species range changes under human-induced global change. Currently investigating how to generate more reliable predictions of biodiversity redistribution under future global change scenarios to better inform conservation decision making. 

Other research interests include disequilibrium in range dynamics under recent climatic change, emerging infectious diseases, monitoring global change effects on biodiversity, and spatial dynamics of biological invasions.
